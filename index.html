                <p>Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.</p><br>
                <li>If you’re looking for an introduction to Sass, check out the tutorial.</li>
                <li>If you want to look up a built-in Sass function, look no further than the built-in module reference.</li>
                <li>If you’re calling Sass from JavaScript, you may want the JS API documentation.</li>
                <li>Or the Dart API documentation if you’re calling it from Dart.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, use the table of contents for the language reference!</li>

                <p>This documentation is written for the most recent version of the Sass language. If you’re using Dart Sass 1.49.9, you’ll have access to all the features described here. But if you’re using an older version of Dart Sass or a deprecated Sass implementation like LibSass or Ruby Sass, there may be some behavioral differences.</p><br>
                <p>Anywhere behavior differs between versions or implementations, the documentation includes a compatibility indicator like this:
    
                        Compatibility (Feature Name):
                        Dart Sass
                        ✓
                        LibSass
                        since 3.6.0
                        Ruby Sass
                        ✗</p><br>
                <p>Implementations with a “✓” fully support the feature in question, and implementations with a “✗” don’t support it all. Implementations with a version number started supporting the feature in question at that version. Implementations can also be marked as “partial”:
    
                        Compatibility:
                        Dart Sass
                        ✓
                        LibSass
                        partial
                        Ruby Sass
                        ✗</p><br>
                <p>This indicates that the implementation only supports some aspects of the feature. These compatibility indicators (and many others) have a “▶” button, which can be clicked to show more details about exactly how the implementations differ and which versions support which aspects of the feature in question.</p>

                    <p>CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass has features that don't exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainable CSS.</p><br>
                    <p>Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.</p><br>
                    <p>The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to. For example, running sass input.scss output.css from your terminal would take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.</p><br>
                    <p>You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file, you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so:</p><br>
                    <code>
                        sass --watch input.scss output.css
                    </code><br>
                    <p>You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:</p><br>
                    <code>
                        sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets
                    </code><br>
                    <p>Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:</p>
                    <code id = "codeColumn">
                        
                        <div class="code-1">
                            <span class="gray">SCSS</span><br><br><br>
                           <span class="green">$font-stack:</span>  Helvetica, <span class="blue">sans-serif;</span> <br>
                            <span class="green">$primary-color: #333;</span><br><br>   
                            <span class="purple">body</span>   {<br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="red">font:</span><span class="green"> 100% $font-stack;</span> <br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="red">color: </span> <span class="green">$primary-color;</span> <br>
                            }
                        </div>
                    
                        <div class="code-2">
                            <span class="gray">CSS</span><br><br><br>
                         <span class="purple">body</span>    {<br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="red">font:</span> <span class="green">100% Helvetica, sans-serif;</span> <br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="red">color:</span> <span class="green"> #333;</span><br>
                             }
                        </div>
                    </code>
                    <p>When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful when working with brand colors and keeping them consistent throughout the site.</p>

                    <p>When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.

                        Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.</p><br>
                    <p>With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a site's navigation:</p><br>

                           <span class="purple">ul </span>{<br>
    
                            &nbsp; <span class="blue">nav</span> { <br>

                    <p>You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use rule.</p>

                    <p>You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want with the @use rule. This rule loads another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file with a namespace based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it generates in your compiled output!</p>

                    <p>Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. In our example we're going to create a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes using another feature which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when it is extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean.</p><br>
                    <p>You can extend most simple CSS selectors in addition to placeholder classes in Sass, but using placeholders is the easiest way to make sure you aren't extending a class that's nested elsewhere in your styles, which can result in unintended selectors in your CSS.</p><br>

                    <p>Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like +, -, *, math.div(), and %. In our example we're going to do some simple math to calculate widths for an article and aside.</p>
